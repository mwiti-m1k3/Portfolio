While initial malware files (payloads) might be caught by antivirus, the running process allows the attacker to maintain a Command and Control (C2) channel, continuously communicating with external servers to receive new instructions, exfiltrate data, or deploy further malicious tools.",

Without breaking persistence, the malware will simply restart upon the next reboot, rendering any file deletion useless. THe goal is to surgically isolate the threat (Containment), remove the threat's executable and startup entries (Eradication), and ensure it can never run again."

            "Maintaining good road safety and pavement quality is crucial since most goods distribution relies on land transport. A well-developed road network enhances transport efficiency, lowers operating costs like fuel and spare parts, and improves overall safety. Recognizing this need, I developed a load management system to address the issue of overloaded vehicles.",
            "The core strategy of this system is to measure a vehicle's total weight by assessing the load exerted on its axles. This method allows for convenient weight measurement anywhere and includes a mechanism to stop overloaded trucks. Specifically, if a vehicle is overloaded, its engine will be prevented from starting or will stop if already running, effectively curbing the problem at its origin.",
            "It features a communication component that can inform authorities, such as weighbridge personnel, via SMS or other integrated methods if a vehicle is overloaded. Consequently, all heavy vehicles equipped with this system can be easily and remotely monitored by weighbridge authorities. This capability significantly saves time and boosts the efficiency of weighbridge operations.",
          "This project involved developing a simple device incorporating a weight measurement system. As a prototype case study, it was implemented using a load cell mounted on an 'axle' and an electric motor to simulate the vehicle’s engine. The system is built around an Arduino microcontroller using the load sensor for weight measurment, a buzzer and LED for alerts, a GSM module for SMS alerts, and the electric motor for engine simulation."

            Hello! I'm Mike, and my professional focus is transforming complex IT infrastructure into a decisive competitive advantage for your business. Drawing on my background in Data Center Operations, I recognize that in today's digital environment, unplanned downtime is simply not an option, and neglecting system management creates a critical liability.

            I provide an integrated service built upon the four pillars of modern IT resilience: Network Architecture, Virtualization Management, Systems Administration, and Information Security Analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures that every layer of your technology—from the core server to the network perimeter—is optimized for stability and performance. I don't just fix problems; I personally ensure your IT services are robust and reliable.
          </p>
